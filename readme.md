## What it does

**Library** — Import audio files once; DJ Manager manages storage and keeps everything organised. Search, sort, and filter by BPM, key, title, duration, and more.

**Analysis** — Every track is analysed automatically for BPM, musical key (displayed in Camelot notation for harmonic mixing), loudness (LUFS), replay gain, and intro/outro markers. Re-analyse any track with a right-click.

**Playlists** — Create colour-coded playlists, drag tracks in, reorder by drag-and-drop, and sort by any column. Track count and total duration shown at all times.

**Player** — Full playback with seekbar, shuffle, repeat, previous/next, hardware media key support, and per-track intro/outro zones shown visually on the seek bar. Double-click any track to play.

**Settings** — Move your library to any location (e.g. an external drive). Update FFmpeg and the audio analyser from inside the app. Clear library or all user data from the Advanced tab.

## How files are stored

Audio is stored at `~/.config/djman/audio/<xx>/<hash>.<ext>` (configurable via Settings → Library). The two-character hash prefix keeps directory sizes manageable. Playlists reference tracks by ID — no duplicates, no copies.

Logs are written daily to `~/.config/djman/logs/app-YYYY-MM-DD.log`.
