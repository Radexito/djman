### Playlist System

* Manual playlists with explicit ordering

* Manual drag-and-drop reordering
* Save & renumber playlist order based on current filters.
* Keyboard-friendly navigation
- hover over track column should show its column not artist name - track name
- thumbnails for id3 tag
- play button on each track
- clicking artist name enables search filters using query language like youtrack.
- search like youtrack using multiple keywords like "bpm: 140-150, order_by: bpm+key"
- Implement real BPM / Key / Energy / loudness detection.
- allow adding tracks to playlists
- export playlists to a folder location (for example USB)
- Add downloading
- add radio.
- Add ID3 Tag editing
- Add track rating
