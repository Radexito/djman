# Rekordbox USB Export Capture Guide

Master reference for all reverse-engineering captures. Read this file first.
Actual capture steps are split into two files:

- **`software_captures.md`** — everything you can do with Rekordbox + a USB drive alone
- **`hardware_captures.md`** — captures that require a CDJ-2000NXS2 or CDJ-3000

**Software required:**

- Rekordbox 6.x (latest stable)
- A USB drive formatted as FAT32 or exFAT (call it `RBDECK` throughout)
- A hex viewer: `xxd`, `hexdump`, or [ImHex](https://github.com/WerWolv/ImHex)

**Hardware required (for `hardware_captures.md` only):**

- CDJ-2000NXS2 or CDJ-3000

**Golden rule:** change exactly ONE thing between consecutive captures. If you
change two things at once the diff is unreadable.

## Setup — Test Tracks

All test tracks live in `test-tracks/` at the root of this repository. They
are gitignored and must be generated locally before starting.

**Before capture 32 only** — create 8 extra copies of `track-normal.mp3` for
the all-12-keys capture (Rekordbox requires each imported file to be unique):

```bash
for key in d dm eb ebm e em f fm; do
  cp test-tracks/track-normal.mp3 test-tracks/track-key-$key.mp3
done
```

## How to Export to USB in Rekordbox

1. Open Rekordbox 6.
2. Drag the track(s) into a Collection or playlist as instructed per capture.
3. Connect the USB drive.
4. In the left sidebar, expand **Devices** → your USB.
5. Drag tracks or playlists to the device as instructed.
6. Click **Sync** (cloud icon) or right-click → **Export to Device**.
7. After export completes, eject the USB safely.
8. Copy the required files from the USB into the capture folder on your computer.

## Files to Copy Per Capture — Checklist

```
[ ] export.pdb
[ ] PIONEER/USBANLZ/<hash>/ANLZ0000.DAT
[ ] PIONEER/USBANLZ/<hash>/ANLZ0000.EXT
[ ] PIONEER/USBANLZ/<hash>/ANLZ0000.2EX    (if present — CDJ-3000 format)
[ ] PIONEER/MYSETTING.DAT
[ ] PIONEER/MYSETTING2.DAT
[ ] PIONEER/DEVSETTING.DAT
[ ] PIONEER/Artwork/                        (artwork captures only)
[ ] notes.txt                               (any measured values: BPM, times, gain dB)
```

When multiple tracks are exported, copy the ANLZ folder for each track.
Name them `ANLZ-track1/`, `ANLZ-track2/` etc. and record which is which in
`notes.txt`.

## Diff Workflow

```bash
# Quick binary diff — prints byte offset + both values for every difference
cmp -l captures/20-gain-default/export.pdb \
       captures/21-gain-plus6db/export.pdb | head -40

# Human-readable hex diff
xxd captures/20-gain-default/export.pdb > /tmp/a.hex
xxd captures/21-gain-plus6db/export.pdb > /tmp/b.hex
diff /tmp/a.hex /tmp/b.hex

# Find a known section tag in an ANLZ file
xxd captures/10-beatgrid-constant-160/PIONEER/USBANLZ/.../ANLZ0000.EXT \
  | grep -A 4 "5051 5432"   # PQT2 in hex

# ImHex (recommended for large files)
# File → Open both files → View → Diff
```

SETTING.DAT: always mask bytes 6–7 before comparing:

```bash
# Strip CRC bytes before diff
python3 -c "
import sys
d = open(sys.argv[1],'rb').read()
print(d[:6].hex(), '????', d[8:].hex())
" captures/110-settings-default/PIONEER/MYSETTING.DAT
```
